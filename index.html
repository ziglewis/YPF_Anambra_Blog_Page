                                <p>Dear Young Professional,</p>
                                <p>Surely, there is an undeniable wisdom a man who has gone through thick and thin in life possesses. Any attempt to disacknowledge it invariably shuts you out from receiving from such man. He has fought a lot of life's battles, difficulties and challenges and has come out victorious. When you discuss with them for a few minutes you would be amazed at the way they speak. </p>
                                <p>They can speak with so much accuracy and precision as to draw out questions yet unspoken in your mind and proffer solutions to what troubles you. The reason is because your challenge is within the confines of their experience and they can draw from that treasury to make sure they satisfy your longing for an answer. They give refreshments to famished souls on life's road. These are men who would never run from any challenge. They know that when any physical difficulty or mountain is mastered and conquered, an intrinsic value or worth is accrued, this to them is worth fighting for.</p>
                                <p>Consistency on this path has made them a depository and repository of wisdom. Little wonder, true men glory in their infirmities. To them there is a power that rests on them by reason of every difficulty that is conquered and that power without fail, comes with wisdom to be wielded accurately. They give life to the statement, "counsel in the heart of a man is like deep waters, and only a man of understanding can draw it out". They are often too relevant in whatever sphere of life they find themselves because of the abundance of their experiences. </p>
                                <p>By reason of having dwelt long on this path of life, they have such a great level of emotional stability that they can absorb whatever comes their way and still smile, not because they are irresponsible, but because they have in their treasury the armoury to fight and conquer. So, they rejoice in advance. All these did not happen in one day, it took time to be built. Any man who must be relevant in his world must allow his life capture the experiences of those who would be under him. </p>
                                <p>If you are living for yourself alone, you may wish to avoid challenges, if you are for a family, you may wish to scarcely face them, but if you are for a nation or a generation, and you run from them, the gap in experience and wisdom will be visible when you get there, and you would be thrown out of the way. But when you face your challenges and beat them small the deliverance of your world would be apportioned to you and you would become a blessing. </p>
                                <p>This is the true beauty of <b>"A WISE SOUL".</b></p>

                                <p>Humanitarianism is about meeting human needs and working to improve people's lives. It serves as an affordable mental health therapy by "all" to those in need. 
                                    When you respond in order to meet a great human need, you are always going to be pushed and changed yourself.
                                </p>
                                <p>The prevailing negative circumstances of life such as sufferings, wars, hunger and starvation have left quite a lot of people in distressful, heart wrenching and mentally destabilized condition with a strong sense of hopelessness.</p>
                                <p>Humanitarianism is an overflow of a strong sense of spirituality. Spirituality in turn is a sense of meaning, purpose, hope and faith.
                                    It is also an individual's understanding of, expression with and connection to that which transcends self. It is related to a deeply held set of personal values and meaning that extends beyond us as individuals.
                                </p>
                                <p>By witnessing the inhumanity of man, humanitarians grow and also cultivate a desire to understand it so that they can defy it.
                                    They are inspired to see their darkest experiences as tools that can shed light on their path towards a greater understanding of their ideals, cause, duties to transcend themselves for the sake of others.
                                </p>
                                <p>As it's rightly opined "Health is Wealth". Humanitarians have an inherent "wealth" that transmits to the    distressed and leaves them with sound mental "health" and fulfillment. </p>

                                <p>What is it about words that make them so endearing? </p>
                                <p>Just like seeds sown in the ground, they grow when we ponder on them. From thoughts, they form our beliefs and from belief they fuel our actions and what we do overtime become our habit.</p>
                                <p>Words, however minute or inconsequential they might seem has a ripple effect when acted on. We cannot underestimate the power of words. No wonder when God created the earth, He spoke and things that are not became real; <b>"Let there be" and "there was".</b> God created man in His own image and gave man the same creative ability that He has as a creator. Hence, whatever name Adam calls the animals, that became their name till date.</p>
                                <p>As professionals, we must be mindful of what we say, how we say it, when we say it, where we say it and for what purpose we say it. "Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks" (Luke 6:45).</p>
                                <p>Keep your heart, mouth and ears in check. For what is in your heart (good or bad) that is what you speak and that can either be a blessing or a curse to others that hear you. </p>
                                <p>You must also be mindful of what you hear. What type of messages do you listen to? What type of songs are on your playlist? Who do you submit yourself to listen to their instructions? All these has an invaluable impact as to how we lead our lives. </p>
                                <p>In your down moments, when you feel you are under performing and life seems to be at its lowest ebb, what do you do?</p>
                                <p>Through words, your spirit can be rejuvenated, your strength renewed and your mind resurged. Words of motivation, words of affirmation, words of inspiration and most importantly, the Word of God. Always get a daily dose of these and your life would keep transcending to higher altitudes.</p>
                                <i>Zig Ziglar said, “People often say that motivation doesn’t last. Well, neither does bathing – that’s why we recommend it daily.”</i>
                                <p>If you spend a few minutes with a chronic complainer who uses all sorts of negative terms, you’ll feel your personal energy being sapped and you gradually gravitate to depression.</p>
                                <p>As you take your daily dose of positive inspiring words, don't forget the importance of repetition and consistency. Repetition is the most powerful tool to imprint something into our minds and keep it there, therefore rehearse in words what you want to become, and you won't be swayed by your present circumstances. </p>
                                <p>Only after being burned a few times can we understand that fire is always hot. You may not remember the exact end date of the Civil War, but odds are you still know what 8 x 9 is because you had to repeat your multiplication tables over and over, drilling it into your consciousness.</p>
                                <p>You don't need to thread on a bad road to tell it is bad, you see it and you know; so, reshuffle your words before you dish them out and not vice versa. </p>
                                <p>In your tongue lies the power of life and death, therefore <b>THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK.</b> </p>

                                <p>Anybody can take a look at something. I mean, we have eyes for that very reason but only some people pay attention to what they <b>see.</b>
                                     The same difference is between listening and hearing.
                                </p>

                                 <p>The ability to look is something we all have, but understanding what one is looking at is an uncommon skill. 
                                    We take in the world through the eyes.
                                    <i>Truly, J. Oswald Sanders was right when he said "Eyes that look are common, but eyes that see are rare ".</i>
                                    Seeing involves Clarity, Reality, and <b>Life as it is</b> (rather than a personal, limited, isolated interpretation, conceptual and judgemental in essence). </p>
                               
                                <p>In this regard, good observational skills are very important. That you don't just come into a place, things are going on and you don't know. Information that can help you, opportunities to thrive. So,  you don't miss out on the things that are meant to benefit you. 
                                        Those who simply look, without judgment, or absence of limited, constrained, personal, perspective are rare. </p>
                                <p>Scripture says in Proverbs chapter 20, verse 12 that the "hearing ear" and the "seeing eyes" are of the Lord. It is also very important to ask God for help so that "the eyes of your understanding may be enlightened" (Ephesians chapter 1, verse 18) </p>   
                                
                                <p>Take cognizance of the minutest things you behold. Be intentional to carefully <b>look and see.</b> </p>

                                    <p>There are ten(10) amazing facts about an eagle you probably did not know.</p>
                                    
                                    <ol>
                                        <li> Did you know that there are Over 60 Species of Eagles?
                                        Most eagle species can be found in Asia and Africa, while the Bald Eagle is native to America. </li>
                                      
                                        <li> Did you know that an Eagle's grip is up to 10 times stronger than humans?
                                        They can usually grab and lift prey that weighs up to a couple of lbs but the largest types of eagles can lift prey up to around 5lbs. </li>
                                     
                                        <li>Did you know that an Eagle's eyesight is up to 8 times stronger than a Humans?
                                        Their vision is so precise that they can spot a rabbit up to 3.2km away.</li>
                                     
                                        <li>Did you know that eagles are cunning, bold and intelligent creatures?
                                            They are known to dive in front of the sun during their attack so their prey is blinded. They don’t let their need for food overrule their tactical thinking and cunning abilities. </li>
                                    
                                        <li> Did you know that a group of Eagles is Called a Convocation?
                                        Hahaha... 😂 Now you know.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Did you know that you can’t pick a Bald Eagle's feather up without a Permit?
                                        In the USA it’s actually illegal to pick a Bald Eagle's feather up without a permit.
                                        This is down to an old law that hasn’t been changed, even though the Bald Eagle isn’t classified as endangered anymore. So, if you’re out on a leisurely walk and you stumble across a Bald Eagle feather, it’s best to leave it well alone, unless you want to risk facing a hefty fine. </li>

                                        <li>Did you know that Eagles mate for Life?
                                        Eagles are loyal birds and when they mate it’s for life, the only time they tend to find a new partner is if their former one dies.  
                                        Male and female eagles both take their parenting roles seriously and both play a crucial part in raising their young. </li>
                                    
                                        <li> Did you know Eagles can turn their head 210 degrees?
                                        Eagles have 14 vertebrae in their necks, compared to humans 7.
                                        This means they’re capable of seeing from a variety of angles and seeking out their prey with ease. </li>

                                       <li>Did you know that bald Eagles are not actually Bald?
                                        The bald eagle has white feathers on its head.
                                        The only reason it’s called bald is that the word comes from the English word “piebald” which means “white-headed.”</li>

                                       <li>Did you know that Eagles are a symbol of Freedom and Peace?
                                        Eagles are often found on state flags and Coat of Arms because they represent courage and freedom and have immense strength and skill.</li>

                                            <p>Hard skills get you hired, but soft skills get you promoted. Bagging the certificate, be it a doctorate degree or the likes is enough to get you hired for your dream job, but soft skills keep you in the job.</p>
                                            <p>Soft skills as listed by <i>Zain Kahn</i> could shatter your dream of developing your hard skills in that firm if not in place. Amongst many others are; <strong>Communication, Persuasiveness, Empathy, Teamwork, Conflict resolution, Emotional intelligence, Work ethics</strong> et cetera.</p>
                                            <p>As an entrepreneur, <strong>persuasiveness</strong> is a soft skill you can't do without; identifying what people care about, creating what resonates with their problems and finding sellable solutions to their challenges would make you stand out in the market place.</p>
                                            <p>As an employee, qualities of <strong>Emotional Intelligence (EI)</strong> will get you promoted; never act impulsively, take a step back when you're upset. Learn <strong>time management;</strong> learn to <b>prioritize</b>, learn to <b>delegate</b>, learn to <b>say no</b> when necessary.</p>
                                            <p>When faced with competition in an industry or firm, your work ethic imbibes in you the virtues that will make you take responsibility for your work, always show up and deliver on time, always keep your commitments, never deflect blame on to others.</p>
                                            <p>Start today, learn soft skills that will help <b>ELEVATE YOUR GAME!</b></p>
