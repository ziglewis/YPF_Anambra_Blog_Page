                                <p>If  we use a map for long enough, we lose sight of the fact the entire journey was based on a plan someone else had for us. We stop questioning it at all. It‚Äôs safe, it‚Äôs secure, it‚Äôs easy, and guaranteed to get us where we‚Äôre going.</p>
                                <p>But...It can only lead to destinations that have already been discovered.Like a blueprint it will only enable us to recreate something according to a predetermined set of specifications. At best we will be able to do what‚Äôs been proven to work. At worst we‚Äôll be nothing but a pale imitation of the travelers who‚Äôve been on this journey before us. A map reveals a Limited Set of possibilities.</p>
                                <p>However, Trusting the compass is a habit, a practice, and a commitment. The first time you trust it and it leads you somewhere unexpected and amazing, you‚Äôll find the courage to trust it again. You‚Äôll let it carry you towards another edge worth exploring. The more you do it, the more it will become your new normal, and eventually you‚Äôll trust the compass more than the map. </p>
                                <p><i>Srinivas Rao ditched his map for a Compass and narrated thus, " ...my own story began with a resume of failures. Then somehow writing a thousand words a day changed my life, and it led to a book, an event, and what today is called The Unmistakable Creative Podcast. Almost none of it has gone according to plan. I‚Äôm not where I thought I‚Äôd be or even who I thought I would be. But, somewhere along the way I found it in me to ditch my map for a compass.</i></p>

                                        <b> Salt</b> <br> 
                                        High salt and sodium intake is one of the major factors that increase the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease and as such affects fluid balance in the blood. When you consume too much salt (which contains sodium), your body holds extra water to balance it with the salt in your body. And this may cause blood pressure to rise because the added water puts stress on your heart and blood vessels. Therefore, it‚Äôs important to significantly curb the amount of salt you take in. Do not take in uncooked salt!
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <b>Red Meat </b> <br> 
                                        Studies have shown that eating red meat can have a significant impact on your blood pressure. In fact, the study showed that eating about 103g/day can increase your blood pressure by 1.25 mmHg and 0.73 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The more 103g/day you eat, the more your mmHg adds up.
                                        Red meats include beef, pork, lamb, venison, veal, and goat meat. The redder the meat, the more strain it will have on your body‚Äôs metabolic process, and the higher your blood pressure will tend to increase. You can try substituting them with leaner meats like chicken etc.     
                                    </li>

                                        <b>White bread  </b> <br>
                                        This is that normal bread you eat. Did you know that a slice of this contains more than 65 calories of white flour, a simple and rapidly digested carbohydrate that causes your blood sugar to rise and crash? And because it has so few nutrients, white bread leaves you feeling hungry for the fiber and vitamins your body needs.
                                        Instead of having this, you can eat whole wheat bread which contains heart-healthy fibers, protein,  magnesium and lots more.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <b>Doughnuts</b> <br>
                                        Let's start from the white flour first and face palm. Then, add in the white sugar and the deep frying process and that's a breathing hazard. One glazed Krispy Kreme doughnut packs 200 calories and 12 grams of fat, including heart-stopping saturated fat, trans fats and cholesterol. You think you're safe because you eat old-fashioned doughnuts? Let me shock you. An old-fashioned cake doughnut is even worse: 300 calories, 28 grams of carbohydrates and a whopping 19 grams of fat, including 5 grams of saturated fat and 4 grams of trans fats. Time to keep that sweet tooth aside. 
                                        You can substitute this for a whole-grain bagel. Note that I said <b>"whole grain"</b>.

                                        <b> Instant noodles  </b> <br>
                                        While noodles can‚Äôt be called a Nigerian food, it has been adopted into Nigeria‚Äôs stream of foods such that it is consumed by both young and old. Nigerians go for noodles because it is cheap, easy and fast to cook, hence the name ‚Äúinstant noodles.‚Äù Tests have revealed that noodles contain high sodium which aside being cancerous, causes heart disease and skin damage. Eating too much of noodles is bad for digestion and it also leads to obesity. 
                                        Are you part of those that have formed a lifelong bond with noodles? Just help me check the calorie content of just one pack and you'll become a believer.

                                        <b>Rice </b> <br>
                                        A lot of us can't do without our daily dose of rice. Well, I come bearing glad tidings. Yes, rice is rich in carbohydrates and fairly low in calories and it is a good source of energy because it is carbohydrate-dense BUT (disc scratch) consuming too much of carbohydrate-dense foods may cause one to eat little of other nutritious meals needed for a healthy life. Eating too much rice could adversely affect glucose metabolism in the body. White rice contains about 4 grams of fiber per cup and consuming it in excess would fill one up preventing intake of other foods. White rice is also low in phytic acid because of the bran which is always removed during processing. Ample research has it that white rice increases the risk of getting diabetes. It is advisable to consume brown rice or reduce the rate of white rice consumption. So please, reduce your intake from twice a day to once a week. 
                                    
                                    </li>

                               </ol>

                                 <p>In conclusion, the calories we consume usually aren‚Äôt from nutritious, low-cal, high-fiber foods such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, or from healthy proteins like lean meat and low-fat dairy foods. Instead, we reach for artery-cloggers: processed cheese that squirts from a can, frosted pastries filled with sugary jam, snack bags of cookies or crackers and pretty much anything deep-fried.
                                    I'm not a killjoy, I'm not saying we should not eat sweet food but rather, let us get to know the worst choices and then, meet some healthier substitutes that offer flavor without quite destroying your body.

                                <p>Try as much as you can to be realistic while setting your goals. Do not be rigid. Understand that things might come up which were unplanned and as such, flexibility is necessary to help you adjust in situations like this. </p>
                                <p>Goals are time-bound and expectations must be brought into line. Get this wrong and you ‚ÄúGive Up‚Äù, thinking the objective was unattainable. You get frustrated and ‚ÄúYou swallow whilst the chewing is still good‚Äù, losing all the goodness of a wonderful experience.</p>
                                <p>It takes Hard Work + Determination + Time = Achievement of Goals, with a little bit of authenticity for seasoning.</p>

                               <p>Truth is, for one to get to the top of a staircase, they have to start climbing first. 
                                If you want to reach that goal that seems so beautiful in your head, start first. 
                                Dreams will forever be just dreams if we fail to manifest them with hard work.

Start from that "tiny" plan, that "small" idea, work towards it as efficiently and effectively as you can and with God on your side, you will watch those "little" things morph into huge rewards.

                                <p>This was my story when I came tardily to church, during one of the combined services. I was so remorseful and was willing to pay off any circumstances that led to it, the situation the next time.
                                    Not up to five minutes later, I saw people storming into the church " wow, I am not the only one late, so why was I beating up myself" I thought.
                                    "Growth is when you stand, even when others are falling" I heard strongly in my spirit.
                                </p>
                                <p>Largely, we feel because everyone is doing something, that means it has to be right but the truth is, most of the time, it's wrong and just because we don't want to feel bad about it, we push it into our subconscious mind, but we can't grow that way, we rather grow when we stand out consistently when others are doing the wrong thing</p>
                                <p>Being unique. Saying No when the world is saying yes. Saying yes in line with God's word, consistently holding on, and not being intimidated by the choice of others, is what growth is.</p>

                                     The same difference is between listening and hearing.
                                </p>

                                 <p>The ability to look is something we all have, but understanding what one is looking at is an uncommon skill. 
                                    We take in the world through the eyes.
                                    <i>Truly, J. Oswald Sanders was right when he said "Eyes that look are common, but eyes that see are rare ".</i>
                                    Seeing involves Clarity, Reality, and <b>Life as it is</b> (rather than a personal, limited, isolated interpretation, conceptual and judgemental in essence). </p>
                               
                                <p>In this regard, good observational skills are very important. That you don't just come into a place, things are going on and you don't know. Information that can help you, opportunities to thrive. So,  you don't miss out on the things that are meant to benefit you. 
                                        Those who simply look, without judgment, or absence of limited, constrained, personal, perspective are rare. </p>
                                <p>Scripture says in Proverbs chapter 20, verse 12 that the "hearing ear" and the "seeing eyes" are of the Lord. It is also very important to ask God for help so that "the eyes of your understanding may be enlightened" (Ephesians chapter 1, verse 18) </p>   
                                
                                <p>Take cognizance of the minutest things you behold. Be intentional to carefully <b>look and see.</b> </p>

Yet, for many of us, those dreams have become so shrouded in the frustrations and rituals of daily life that we no longer even make an effort to attain them. For far too many, the dream has become nonexistent, and the will to shape our futures along with it. </p>
                                <p>Nonetheless, Most people have no idea of the giant capacity we can immediately command when we focus all of our resources on mastering and conquering a single area of our lives. Controlled focus is like a laser beam that can cut through anything that seems to be stopping you. </p>
                                <p> <i>When we focus consistently on improvement in any area, we develop unique distinctions on how to make that area better. When we put our minds to a definite goal, it creates an easier way for us to achieve it. - Benjamin DISRAELI </i> </p>

                               <p>Did you know that you can develop your spiritual muscles just like you do physically? Oh yes! You can. This is done through daily obedience to the revealed truth by the Spirit of God irrespective of how insignificant it may seem to you, coupled with fervent praying in the Holy Ghost and consistent studying of the Word of God.</p>
                               <p>Exercise daily by doing little things in the right, true and noble way. Ensure your life is in consonance with the Word of God and you have the strong abiding presence of God in all you do.</p>

                                As it is written in Hebrews 11:28, "Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear." This becomes our daily experience - having grace to serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.
                               </p>
                                <p>Such a man has been set to do the biddings God. To be a symbol of righteousness and one conformed to the image and will of God. He is then ever so set as true as steel and as enduring as the sun.
                                    As young professionals, it is important to pay attention to the minutest detail of your personal, spiritual and professional life. Take them seriously and invest your efforts in them, for where your treasure is there your heart will be also.

                                <p>Everyone talks about money; some because they don‚Äôt have enough, some wish to make more, and some are simply obsessed with it. It has always been this way, but nowadays, making money seems to be the main goal on everyone‚Äôs ‚Äòto-do list'. </p>
                                <i>But Maxime Lagace would say, "make your goal more than the money..."</i>
                                <p>We‚Äôve never had so many options when it comes to products, technology, and services. Salesmen continually try to convince us that we need them all to live a happier and more comfortable life. But do we?</p>
                                <p>In the past, people didn‚Äôt have so much to choose from. Now, we want a blender with six functions that we don‚Äôt even use. We want expensive clothes that we don‚Äôt even like, but they are ‚Äútrendy‚Äù so we still buy them to impress others around us.</p>
                                <i>"Stop buying things you don‚Äôt need, to impress people you don‚Äôt even like". - Suze Orman </i>
                                <p>In the pursuit of getting all the things we want, but don‚Äôt need, we lose precious time, relationships, and ultimately ourselves. Of course, money is a means to an end. We need it for comfort, education, medical procedures, and so on, but we should always remember that there‚Äôs so much to this life and that "time is the real money".</p>

                                <p>Dear Young Professional,</p>
                                <p>Surely, there is an undeniable wisdom a man who has gone through thick and thin in life possesses. Any attempt to disacknowledge it invariably shuts you out from receiving from such man. He has fought a lot of life's battles, difficulties and challenges and has come out victorious. When you discuss with them for a few minutes you would be amazed at the way they speak. </p>
                                <p>They can speak with so much accuracy and precision as to draw out questions yet unspoken in your mind and proffer solutions to what troubles you. The reason is because your challenge is within the confines of their experience and they can draw from that treasury to make sure they satisfy your longing for an answer. They give refreshments to famished souls on life's road. These are men who would never run from any challenge. They know that when any physical difficulty or mountain is mastered and conquered, an intrinsic value or worth is accrued, this to them is worth fighting for.</p>
                                <p>Consistency on this path has made them a depository and repository of wisdom. Little wonder, true men glory in their infirmities. To them there is a power that rests on them by reason of every difficulty that is conquered and that power without fail, comes with wisdom to be wielded accurately. They give life to the statement, "counsel in the heart of a man is like deep waters, and only a man of understanding can draw it out". They are often too relevant in whatever sphere of life they find themselves because of the abundance of their experiences. </p>
                                <p>By reason of having dwelt long on this path of life, they have such a great level of emotional stability that they can absorb whatever comes their way and still smile, not because they are irresponsible, but because they have in their treasury the armoury to fight and conquer. So, they rejoice in advance. All these did not happen in one day, it took time to be built. Any man who must be relevant in his world must allow his life capture the experiences of those who would be under him. </p>
                                <p>If you are living for yourself alone, you may wish to avoid challenges, if you are for a family, you may wish to scarcely face them, but if you are for a nation or a generation, and you run from them, the gap in experience and wisdom will be visible when you get there, and you would be thrown out of the way. But when you face your challenges and beat them small the deliverance of your world would be apportioned to you and you would become a blessing. </p>
                                <p>This is the true beauty of <b>"A WISE SOUL".</b></p>

                                        <li> Did you know that there are Over 60 Species of Eagles?
                                        Most eagle species can be found in Asia and Africa, while the Bald Eagle is native to America. </li>
                                      
                                        <li> Did you know that an Eagle's grip is up to 10 times stronger than humans?
                                        They can usually grab and lift prey that weighs up to a couple of lbs but the largest types of eagles can lift prey up to around 5lbs. </li>
                                     
                                        <li>Did you know that an Eagle's eyesight is up to 8 times stronger than a Humans?
                                        Their vision is so precise that they can spot a rabbit up to 3.2km away.</li>
                                     
                                        <li>Did you know that eagles are cunning, bold and intelligent creatures?
                                            They are known to dive in front of the sun during their attack so their prey is blinded. They don‚Äôt let their need for food overrule their tactical thinking and cunning abilities. </li>
                                    
                                        <li> Did you know that a group of Eagles is Called a Convocation?
                                        Hahaha... Now you know.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Did you know that you can‚Äôt pick a Bald Eagle's feather up without a Permit?
                                        In the USA it‚Äôs actually illegal to pick a Bald Eagle's feather up without a permit.
                                        This is down to an old law that hasn‚Äôt been changed, even though the Bald Eagle isn‚Äôt classified as endangered anymore. So, if you‚Äôre out on a leisurely walk and you stumble across a Bald Eagle feather, it‚Äôs best to leave it well alone, unless you want to risk facing a hefty fine. </li>

                                        <li>Did you know that Eagles mate for Life?
                                        Eagles are loyal birds and when they mate it‚Äôs for life, the only time they tend to find a new partner is if their former one dies.  
                                        Male and female eagles both take their parenting roles seriously and both play a crucial part in raising their young. </li>
                                    
                                        <li> Did you know Eagles can turn their head 210 degrees?
                                        Eagles have 14 vertebrae in their necks, compared to humans 7.
                                        This means they‚Äôre capable of seeing from a variety of angles and seeking out their prey with ease. </li>

                                       <li>Did you know that bald Eagles are not actually Bald?
                                        The bald eagle has white feathers on its head.
                                        The only reason it‚Äôs called bald is that the word comes from the English word ‚Äúpiebald‚Äù which means ‚Äúwhite-headed.‚Äù</li>

                                       <li>Did you know that Eagles are a symbol of Freedom and Peace?
                                        Eagles are often found on state flags and Coat of Arms because they represent courage and freedom and have immense strength and skill.</li>

                                <p>Humanitarianism is about meeting human needs and working to improve people's lives. It serves as an affordable mental health therapy by "all" to those in need. 
                                    When you respond in order to meet a great human need, you are always going to be pushed and changed yourself.

                                <p>The prevailing negative circumstances of life such as sufferings, wars, hunger and starvation have left quite a lot of people in distressful, heart wrenching and mentally destabilized condition with a strong sense of hopelessness.</p>
                                <p>Humanitarianism is an overflow of a strong sense of spirituality. Spirituality in turn is a sense of meaning, purpose, hope and faith.
                                    It is also an individual's understanding of, expression with and connection to that which transcends self. It is related to a deeply held set of personal values and meaning that extends beyond us as individuals.
                                </p>
                                <p>By witnessing the inhumanity of man, humanitarians grow and also cultivate a desire to understand it so that they can defy it.
                                    They are inspired to see their darkest experiences as tools that can shed light on their path towards a greater understanding of their ideals, cause, duties to transcend themselves for the sake of others.
                                </p>
                                <p>As it's rightly opined "Health is Wealth". Humanitarians have an inherent "wealth" that transmits to the    distressed and leaves them with sound mental "health" and fulfillment. </p>

                                            <p>Just like seeds sown in the ground, they grow when we ponder on them. From thoughts, they form our beliefs and from belief they fuel our actions and what we do overtime become our habit.</p>
                                            <p>Words, however minute or inconsequential they might seem has a ripple effect when acted on. We cannot underestimate the power of words. No wonder when God created the earth, He spoke and things that are not became real; <b>"Let there be" and "there was".</b> God created man in His own image and gave man the same creative ability that He has as a creator. Hence, whatever name Adam calls the animals, that became their name till date.</p>
                                            <p>As professionals, we must be mindful of what we say, how we say it, when we say it, where we say it and for what purpose we say it. "Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks" (Luke 6:45).</p>
                                            <p>Keep your heart, mouth and ears in check. For what is in your heart (good or bad) that is what you speak and that can either be a blessing or a curse to others that hear you. </p>
                                            <p>You must also be mindful of what you hear. What type of messages do you listen to? What type of songs are on your playlist? Who do you submit yourself to listen to their instructions? All these has an invaluable impact as to how we lead our lives. </p>
                                            <p>In your down moments, when you feel you are under performing and life seems to be at its lowest ebb, what do you do?</p>
                                            <p>Through words, your spirit can be rejuvenated, your strength renewed and your mind resurged. Words of motivation, words of affirmation, words of inspiration and most importantly, the Word of God. Always get a daily dose of these and your life would keep transcending to higher altitudes.</p>
                                            <i>Zig Ziglar said, ‚ÄúPeople often say that motivation doesn‚Äôt last. Well, neither does bathing ‚Äì that‚Äôs why we recommend it daily.‚Äù</i>
                                            <p>If you spend a few minutes with a chronic complainer who uses all sorts of negative terms, you‚Äôll feel your personal energy being sapped and you gradually gravitate to depression.</p>
                                            <p>As you take your daily dose of positive inspiring words, don't forget the importance of repetition and consistency. Repetition is the most powerful tool to imprint something into our minds and keep it there, therefore rehearse in words what you want to become, and you won't be swayed by your present circumstances. </p>
                                            <p>Only after being burned a few times can we understand that fire is always hot. You may not remember the exact end date of the Civil War, but odds are you still know what 8 x 9 is because you had to repeat your multiplication tables over and over, drilling it into your consciousness.</p>
                                            <p>You don't need to thread on a bad road to tell it is bad, you see it and you know; so, reshuffle your words before you dish them out and not vice versa. </p>
                                            <p>In your tongue lies the power of life and death, therefore <b>THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK.</b> </p>
